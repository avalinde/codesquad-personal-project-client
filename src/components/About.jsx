              The Boston Informed Consent Directory seeks to make it easy for
              transgender and questioning individuals to receive
              gender-affirming care. <br />

              <h2>Why the Informed Consent Model of Gender-Affirming Care?</h2>
              <p>
              The informed consent model for gender-affirming treatment,
              proposed in a number of transgender health guidelines and by
              practicing clinicians seeks to better acknowledge and support
              patients right of, and their capability for, personal autonomy in
              choosing care options without the requirement of external
              evaluations or therapy by mental health professionals. Through a
              discussion of risks and benefits of possible treatment options
              with the patient—a discussion that considers the current state of
              scientific knowledge as well as the cultural and social context of
              treatment decisions and that respects the patient's capacity for
              self-knowledge—clinicians work to assist patients in making
              decisions. This approach recognizes that patients are the only
              ones who are best positioned, in the context of their lived
              experience, to assess and judge beneficence (i.e., the potential
              improvement in their welfare that might be achieved), and it also
              affords prescribing clinicians a better and fuller sense of how a
              particular patient balances principles of nonmaleficence and
              beneficence. Ultimately, clinicians' use of the informed consent
              model can lead to the possibility of a richer understanding of the
              patient and the potential for better patient care overall.
              However, the model does not remove the expectation that the
              clinician will inquire about and understand the possible impact of
              gender dysphoria on the patient's emotional state and psychosocial
              functioning; in fact, it assumes that this will factor into the
              discussion of risks and benefits but allows the patients
              themselves to weigh these potential impacts. On the other hand,
              the SOC's continued reliance on mental health professionals to
              determine eligibility and readiness for treatment perpetuates a
              message that neither the patient nor the prescribing clinician is
              capable of a nuanced discussion of gender variance and its
              management. <br />
