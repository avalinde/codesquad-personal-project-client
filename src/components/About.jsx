              <h2>Why the Informed Consent Model of Gender-Affirming Care?</h2>
              <p>
                The informed consent model is beneficial for because it centers the autonomy and agency of transgender individuals in making decisions about their medical transition. Instead of requiring lengthy psychological evaluations or gatekeeping, this model allows patients to access gender-affirming treatments—such as hormone therapy or surgeries—after being fully informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. This approach reduces barriers, respects individuals’ knowledge of their own identities, and leads to improved mental health outcomes by enabling timely and affirming treatment.
