##Tech used: 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet, Formcarry, React.js

Full crud operations functional via admin console. Admin console secured by login authentication with backend. Formcarry API creates a functional emailing contact page. Styling completed via CSS with consistent aesthetic on variety of platforms. 


## Lessons Learned:

As the first full-stack web application completed by this developer, this product taught me many lessons- How to implement CRUD operations with a front and back end that communicate, how to work with open source API's for app features, website styling guidelines, and many more. To the community that supported me through this, I cannot express enough gratitude- thank you CodeSquad. Access to healthcare and transgender rights are human rights.
